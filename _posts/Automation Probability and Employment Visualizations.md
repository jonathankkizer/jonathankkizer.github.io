## Automation Probability and Employment Visualizations

<center>![Employment Analysis](/public/automation.png)</center>

Quick graphic that I made last night by combining an Oxford Martin School of Business [research paper](http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/publications/view/1314) into the probability of computerization (automation) of various industries with the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics [report on employment by sector](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm). It's part of a research paper I'm currently writing, but the chart starts to show the type of impact this technology could have moving forward. Even if the formula vastly overstates probability, the actual numbers are so large that a massive disruption in the world economy still seems very likely.

This is what a disruptive economic trend looks like.
