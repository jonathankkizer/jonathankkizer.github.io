## Applying Blockchain Technology to the Supply Network

The concept of a blockchain was originally developed as the underpinnings of the crypto-currency Bitcoin**[1]**, which relied on the blockchain for its distributed peer-to-peer network. This blockchain network in turn provided security and neutrality for the Bitcoin currency, supporting Bitcoin’s growth to become the largest crypto-currency by market capitalization. 

As Bitcoin’s blockchain implementation successfully scaled with the currency it supported, interested parties began to take notice. 

Marc Andreesen, venture capitalist and co-author of the first web browser, succinctly described a long-standing issue in internet communication of “how to establish trust between otherwise unrelated parties over an untrusted network like the Internet.” Andreesen continues, “The practical consequence of solving this problem is that [a blockchain] gives us, for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another Internet user, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer. The consequences of this breakthrough are hard to overstate.”**[2]**

This same fundamental problem can be seen within the supply chain of many companies. As companies attempt to make the transparency of their supply chain a marketing and competitive advantage, a clear conflict of interests arises. Using a traditional database to store details about a product, suppliers, raw materials, transportation, and other pertinent information creates three clear problems. 

1. suppliers and companies are incentivized to portray themselves as positively as possible, and so falsifying or providing incomplete information is an issue. 
2. outside parties have no way to verify that the database has not been edited to portray suppliers or a company in a better light. 
3. a centralized database is far more susceptible to problems involving server outages, power disruptions, data corruption, and/or security compromises.

The preferred solution — particularly in the realm of online payments — has been the introduction of an interested, vested party. These are typically financial institutions and payment processing companies (e.g., Visa, Paypal, etc.). Such a solution clearly carries additional costs and complexity, and scales poorly to the realm of supply chain tracking and verification, as fees and other incentive structures quickly eat into the margin of purchasers and suppliers.

Consequently, the aforementioned three major problems with traditional, siloed databases have continued to be an obstacle for advanced supply chain tracking, verification, and transparency efforts.

Applying a blockchain across a supply chain, in theory, resolves many of these issues. Because of the distributed nature of the blockchain, any change to a record is recorded and possible to trace — therefore, if a supplier were to edit data to portray themselves more positively or favorably, any interested party would be able to both see this change and trace the original value. 

This effectively removes the advantage of such dishonest behavior, eliminating the aforementioned first and second problems. For the previously-mentioned third issue, the distributed nature of any blockchain again provides an additional layer of security: if any malicious changes are made, or a component is taken offline due to natural disasters or bad actors, the blockchain is able to largely continue unaffected, as all records are stored in multiple locations.

A blockchain is relatively simple to create, and again, “blockchains do not require producing ‘coins’ that can be traded and exchanged for physical money. 

Blockchains are used to store and verify information.”**[3]** By replacing the “coin” with information pertinent to a supply chain (e.g., a barcoded part flowing through production, the weight of a truck shipment as it leaves a distribution center, the latitude and longitude of produce so consumers can later check to see if it truly is local, etc.), various companies are beginning to offer blockchain-based storage and verification information systems.

Two notable startups have published white papers detailing their blockchain-based supply chain technology. Ambrosus, one of the supply chain-centric blockchain providers, states that its platform is “used to store readings of specified attributes collected for a given item at specified points along a supply chain”**[4]** after collecting them using a wide array of sensors and standardized barcodes. 

Provenance, another supply chain information system based on blockchain technology, additionally envisions a consumer app**[5]**, where any participating product’s barcode can be scanned to show the “lifecycle” of that product: provenance, manufacturing, transportation, and any other relevant information.

Ambrosus and Provenance are likely pioneers in a field that will soon become very crowded. Given the rising importance of a supply chain and its transparency for marketing efforts, and rising concerns from consumers about production location and conditions, as well as the current detractors form existing database systems, a blockchain-based approach appears to carry great potential. Early adopters and experimental rollouts of blockchain technology have already found success: for example, in some areas, buyers of Cargill’s Honeysuckle White turkeys for Thanksgiving were able to determine the exact farm from which their turkey originated from using their smartphone.**[6]**

Considering the aforementioned three major problems that a blockchain-based supply network information system solves, and the massive benefits in transparency and scalability inherent to the system, blockchain technology is a concept that every company with a competitive supply chain should investigate and, where feasible and practical, implement moving forward.
