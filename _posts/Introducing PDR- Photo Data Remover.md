## Introducing PDR: Photo Data Remover for iOS

<center>![PDR](/public/PDR.png)</center>

Hot off the heels of [PhotoLocate](https://jonathankizer.com/PhotoLocate/), my dive into the mysterious, often poorly-documented world of Apple's wrapper object for photos and videos within the stock Photos app has produced a second project: [Photo Data Remover, or PDR for short](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdr-photo-data-remover/id1450225401).

PDR is straighforward, both in purpose and use case: it strips information from an image, leaving only the data needed to show the actual visual photo.

"But wait! What information besides the photo is included in the file every time I take a photo?"

Great question.

Depending on your camera, every time you tap the shutter button, a lot more information than just the actual image is saved. That includes latitude and longitude, time of day, time zone, camera type, lighting info, and various other data points.

When kept locally, this data is actually very useful (see PhotoLocate for how useful the coordinates can be). But! When sending photos across the web, this info can be used by advertisers and creeps alike.

PDR allows you to take control of the information you send every time you share a photo, whether to a friend, Facebook, or anywhere else across the web.

[PDR is available for free on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdr-photo-data-remover/id1450225401), and should work on all iPhones running iOS 12 or greater. Let me know if you have any questions or requests!
