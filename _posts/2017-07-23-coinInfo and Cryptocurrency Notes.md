## coinInfo and Cryptocurrency Notes

The rise of Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and various other "coins") has been relatively astronomic. 

Fiat currency (or what the rest of the world considers to be money) has long not really represented any concrete measurement of wealth -- but societies around the world have agreed that certain pieces of paper are worth something, and so it works. This isn't meant as a slight to fiat currency: these paper currencies are easily converted into raw materials or other goods in a way that cryptocurrencies currrently aren't, and may never be. But this ability exists as a result of a societal agreement, and not necessarily anything more.

I do not understand many of the technical aspects of these cryptocurrencies. I intend to change that, but reading documentation and other implementation details takes time -- and I haven't quite made the time for that yet.

### Restricted Supply = Value (sometimes)

Regardless: they each share a foundation of difficult math to create restricted supply (something that doesn't typical happen in the digital world; you can simply copy/paste a file infinitely times; if you can copy/paste one dollar a million times, it becomes worthless -- super inflation!). And so computers "mine" coins by solving increasingly difficult problems that require compute power (and therefore electricity, as well as expensive components) and time.

This limited supply of coins means that trading can take place, and it actively does. Using online trading platforms -- similar in UI/UX as other stock trading platforms -- people can convert USD to Bitcoin or Ethereum, and then purchase other coins. These coins rise and fall regularly in price.

As a result of most coins having little value or utility besides the belief in its future, they are incredibly susceptible to popular opinion. News about an impending Bitcoin deadline is enough to send the market off a cliff. Similarly, a [person showing a "Bitcoin" sign behind Janet Yellen](http://fortune.com/2017/07/12/bitcoin-buy-yellen-fed-testimony/) is enough to rally the market.

It's an interesting dive into a world where CAPM models have essentially no place -- analysis is difficult, because each move often revolves around less information than stocks often provide.

Anyhow, I'm currently operating on the premise that most trades are bad trades; limit the number of trades I make, try to buy coins that appear to have differentiated, useful features tied to their implementation, and hold on. I've currently made a 50% return, although that fluxuates wildly.

#### coinInfo

I grew tired of using websites that required a lot of security to quickly check on prices and trends. So I wrote a simply Python script/program for it.

[You can check it out here on GitHub](https://github.com/jonathankkizer/coinInfo). If you want info about a particular coin, simply run coinInfo, and type the coin. It'll return a handful of useful metrics. 

It's super simple, and relies on [coinmarketcap](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coinmarketcap) for all the hard work; be sure to install that first, if you're interested in coinInfo.

### Mix

Vertcoin, Antshares, Monero, some Bitcoin, and a little bit of Ethereum. That's my current mix.
