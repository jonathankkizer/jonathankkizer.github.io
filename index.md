I am a data engineer/analyst/scientist with experience in various fields. I currently work at Apple, helping to quantify and minimize the environmental impact of various product lines. I also have direct experience in healthcare and telecommunications. 

I enjoy working with Python and SQL at all levels of the data stack. I enjoy both data engineering complex data analysis and model creation.

In my free time, I love being out in the beautiful Rocky Mountains of Colorado. You can find me on my motorcycle, hiking, or jogging whenever the weather allows (and sometimes when it doesn't)!
