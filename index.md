I'm a data engineer and former analyst with direct experience in healthcare and, currently, high-tech manufacturing and supply chain environmental impact. I have experience helping to answer the big questions -- the questions that are needed to influence strategy, direction, and KPIs, from individual markets to the boardroom.

I currently work at Apple as a Data and Analytics Engineer inside of the operations organization where I own large parts of the data warehousing and modeling of environmental impact data across the supply chain and product lines.

I enjoy working with Python and SQL at all levels of the data stack. I enjoy both data engineering and complex data analysis. Please see my resume for more information.

In my free time, I love being out in the beautiful Rocky Mountains of Colorado. You can find me on my motorcycle, hiking, or jogging. I have a personal interest in iOS development, climatology data, and Formula 1.

I am currently pursuing a [Master of Science in Analytics degree from Georgia Tech](https://www.analytics.gatech.edu), and expecting to graduate in May 2023.
